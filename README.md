a smart signature monitor scraper for NFT drops 

built this back when i had a nft bot and support for merkle proof 

what this used to do is monitor a site when they drop the method for merkle proof ( API , or local list of addresses ) 

and it will catch when they drop the method , and the type of method and the info about it
